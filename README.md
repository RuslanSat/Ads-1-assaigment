# Java Algorithmic Problems with Recursion & Iteration

This repository contains Java solutions for algorithmic problems, covering recursion, iteration, and basic computational tasks. Each program includes execution time measurement and time complexity analysis.

## Problems & Solutions

1. **Task1.java** - Finds the minimum value in a given array of `n` elements.
2. *Task2.java** - Computes the average of `n` numbers.
3. **Task3.java** - Determines whether a given number `n` is prime.
4. **Task4.java** - Computes the factorial of `n` using recursion.
5. **Task5.java** - Finds the `n`-th Fibonacci number using recursion.
6. **Task6.java** - Calculates `a^n` using recursion.
7. **Task7.java** - Reads `n` numbers and prints them in reverse order using recursion (without using arrays).
8. **Task8.java** - Checks whether a given string consists only of digits.

## Usage

Each program is implemented in Java. Compile and run using:

```sh
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
